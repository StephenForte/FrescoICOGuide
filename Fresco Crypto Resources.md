An open source guide to ICOs.

#### Background and Purpose of this Document

When the first known ICO was launched in July 2013 (Mastercoin, according to Wikipedia), few were aware that this form of fundraising even existed and few of those who were aware that it existed would have predicted that ICOs would become one of the dominant forms of fundraising for technology companies in 2017.

Indeed, ICOs have quickly progressed from a unique form of fundraising to a mainstream phenomenon.  On one hand, they have become a viable option for entrepreneurs seeking to raise capital for innovative concepts, on their own terms, without the oversight of regulators and VCs.  On the other hand, ICOs have also supported fundraising by companies without a viable business plan or experienced management.  This means government regulators are struggling to keep up, and these unregulated offerings have also attracted a dark contingent of disingenuous (if not outright dishonest) players keen to make a quick return on an alluring cocktail of profit speculation and token euphoria.

At the same time, ICOs have become a viable option for startups looking to raise capital.  Governmental organizations in every country are struggling to contemporaneously regulate all aspects of ICOs, which means that this form of fundraising - in some shape or form - is not going away anytime soon.

Fresco Capital is a global early stage venture fund, and our mission is building global ecosystems that enable entrepreneurs to leverage technology to solve the world’s most critical challenges.  As such, we are inherently supportive of innovation in capital markets as well as any globally viable mechanism through which entrepreneurs can fund transformative solutions.  We believe in the power of aligned incentives, and have an agnostic view on ICOs as a fundraising mechanism - the same as we do about bonds, commercial loans, crowdfunding, factoring, and equity. Each company, including each of our portfolio companies, has a unique need and commercial objectives that need to be considered when determining which (or what combination of) available sources of funds is most appropriate for their business to achieve their growth and operational targets. ICOs may, or may not, be a feasible and appropriate part of that mix. 

We believe it is critical to understand tokens and ICOs, like we understand all of asset classes and funding mechanisms. As the cryptocurrency and ICO markets are evolving faster than any one person can keep up, we have created this document as an open source reference to be used to understand and keep updated with respect to this topic. We encourage you to ask questions, update information that has changed, and share globally relevant suggestions on how to navigate this exciting and complex new ecosystem. 

Sincerely,

Team Fresco.

**BACKGROUND INFORMATION**

Discussions of an ICO are incomplete without a discussion of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology (i.e., distributed ledger technology). These topics, along, could fill volumes,so we aim to highlight only the relevant points below:

 

**WHAT IS CRYPTOCURRENCY?**

* Digital assets that use cryptography to validate activities associated with them (e.g. transactions). These assets are often in the form of **Tokens**.

* Tokens are a digital representation of a set of rights to a specific platform, often referred to as an **underlying utility. **Common analogies include gift card/software licenses, which provide the right to access a predetermined set of goods or services.

* An** underlying utility** can include, but is not limited to:

    * Right to access and use or consume an organization's’ service or product

    * The power to vote on decisions made by the organization issuing the token

    * Receive a share of future earnings (less common, and may be associated to a security)

    * Anyone can hold cryptocurrencies, and anyone can validate transactions related to them (a process known as "mining"), often earning reward in form of obtaining more of that cryptocurrency.

 

**WHAT IS BLOCKCHAIN?**

* **A digital ledger**, or a continuously growing list of records that contains details of transactions/activities.  To ensure complete anonymity, these details are bundled together into **blocks **of information, which are then encrypted and distributed to many individuals users, forming a chain of information.

* **Decentralized**—As a collective unit, all the users along the chain hold the records.  New blocks of transactions require verification by the collective unit, so the process removes the need for a trusted central organization, such as a bank or central government, to verify and maintain transactions, thus achieving decentralization and preventing the possibility of abuse of power by a single entity or group of people.

* **Continuous** Any token issued, as well as any subsequent activities for which these tokens are used, also have to operate on a Blockchain, and are thus regulated in the same decentralized, anonymous fashion.

 

**WHAT ARE THE MAJOR CRYPTOCURRENCIES?**

The major cryptocurrencies currently being used for real world payments and ICOs are Bitcoin and Ethereum. For a current list of each cryptocurrency and their market cap, see here: [https://coinmarketcap.com/](https://coinmarketcap.com/)

#### WHAT IS AN ICO?

An ICO is an acronym for Initial Coin Offering. The acronym, whether intentional or not, looks and sounds similar to the more well-known "IPO" and, indeed, reflects that companies are offering to third parties, for the first time, coins (which are referred to as Tokens). 

Buyers (subscribers) pay money in exchange for tokens. Usually, buyers pay for new tokens cryptocurrency (Bitcoin and Etherium are the most popular, but others are accepted also on a case-by-case basis). There are multiple structures and requirements, for contributions. In most cases, companies considering an ICO will hire a team similar to an investment banking team in traditional Wall Street finance.  This team implements an end-to-end contribution process, either by engaging several different vendors who are each responsible for a part, or by providing a turnkey solution that can provide the entire solution. 

**Token Creation:**

Tokens must first be created in order for them to be issued to investors. As of now, there are two primary ways of creating new tokens:

* **Token Creation on an Existing Protocol:** Protocols including Ethereum (the most popular), Stellar, Omni, Waves, Counterparty etc.

* **Token Creation on a Proprietary Protocol:** Companies can write your own native Blockchain/Protocol and create Tokens on top of it.

**Token Issuance:**

The two major issues from the creation and issuance of Tokens are, first, the actual issuance of the Token, and, second, the purpose of the Token.

When described above, the exchange of a new Token for an investment seems simple enough. Our entire society exists on the seamless exchange of something (money, tickets, etc.) for something (pizza, movies, etc.); but the ICO market expanded so rapidly that, in some cases, the infrastructure needed to support a proper ICO lagged behind. For example, some ICOs accepted money but did not deliver Tokens (or delivered Tokens late). 

Generally, the company issuing the Tokens dictates the timing of the process.  In most cases, investors do not (in some / many cases) receive Token instantaneously (i.e., in real time). Instead, there are milestones set to determine when Tokens will be issued to various groups of buyers who may have contributed amounts at different times. This creates a risk that Token issuance will be delayed or not issued at all, in which case, it will be extremely difficult (if not impossible) to secure the return of invested funds. In some cases, the delay of issuance is because the company is understaffed, underprepared, or experienced some unexpected issues. In some cases, companies simply don’t care, after realizing that they have no enforceable obligation to deliver on their promises.

**Token Classification: Are they securities?**

The second issue, which is among the hottest topics in all financial markets, is whether Tokens are securities. This is determined by their purpose.

If their purpose is "utility", then tokens are not securities.  For example, let’s use the analogy of a cinema.  When you go to the cinema and buy a ticket, you can only use that ticket to get into the show you paid for. You cannot get dividends from the cinema, you do not share their profits, and you do not have any voting rights. The ticket has the “utility” of letting you watch a film. For this reason, cinemas do not need special licenses to issue tickets. 

If their purpose is to represent ownership, then tokens are securities.  When a company issues stock (which is a security) in exchange for money, the stock certificate allows the owner to vote and receive dividends as a share of the company’s profits. The company needs approval from their financial services regulator, and must go through a long and expensive process, to have approval to issue the stock.

So, if a Token is considered to be a "Utility Token", the ICO can go on with minimum oversight and regulation (like a cinema issuing tickets of any color size and for any price regardless of whether or not the film is good). But, if the Token is considered to be a “Security Token”, then things get more complicated, with the company issuing the Token potentially in violation of securities laws (and potentially violating different laws in different countries). 

Initially, (i.e., up until mid-2017ish), ICOs gained in popularity because many people bought into the idea of "This is great, I can raise money without a lot of regulations because I am just giving people a Token, not a stock." whereas the pendulum is beginning to swing the other way with many regulators taking increasingly aggressive positions against Tokens that look like and smell like securities. 

The potential outcome is two-fold: (i) classifying Tokens as securities would dramatically shrink the market as fewer companies would be willing to spend the time, money, and effort to undertake the securities process; and (ii) companies that have already issued Tokens may be subject to liability under securities laws.

There are countless articles and resources about how to evaluate whether a Token is a security or not. We have linked to some good ones below:

* [https://medium.com/startup-grind/understanding-the-difference-between-coins-utility-tokens-and-tokenized-securities-a6522655fb91](https://medium.com/startup-grind/understanding-the-difference-between-coins-utility-tokens-and-tokenized-securities-a6522655fb91) 

In general, to be classified as a Utility Token, the token has to serve a functional purpose. Examples: Tokens are used to gain access to a system (i.e., gain access to data, the ability to play an online game, etc.) or used as digital currency in a system (i.e., can be exchanged for features, functions, etc.).

If the utility case is absent, the token may be regarded as security, which makes it heavily regulated. In the U.S., the courts have developed something called the [Howey Test](https://medium.com/bittrust/passing-the-howey-test-how-to-regulate-blockchain-tokens-d218da93a8b6) to evaluate whether a token is a security. The test has 4 parts - previously, aggressive companies justified their Token being a Utility Token on the basis that 1 of the 4 parts was not met. For example, they considered the 4 parts to be the 4 legs of a table and believe that if 1 leg was missing the table would fall. Now, more conservative thinking is that even if 1 leg is missing from a table, you can still tell that it is a table (it does not suddenly look like a chair or a lamp).

**CANDIDATES FOR AN ICO**

If you are an entrepreneur looking to raise capital, you may be asking yourself, "Should I issue an ICO?"  Below are several examples of when an ICO may make sense for you:

* **Blockchain-based startups**: hope to grow significantly using the funds obtained.

* **Organizations with an established and validated technology and business:** In this case, issuing a proprietary token could incentivize the usage and monetization of an online network through distributing tokens for using the organization's’ services

* If you **have a real use case of blockchain technology** with solving your business problem

If you fit these criteria, it doesn’t matter how much money you are looking to raise.  While some ICOs set minimum commitment requirements, there is no average ticket size for fundraising - ZrCoin raised US$7M from 3,955 investors (NOTE:  https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2017/06/101872-zrcoin-ico-claims-7-million-raised-3955-investors/), while BAT raised US$36M from 190 investors (NOTE:  http://www.trustnodes.com/2017/05/31/ethereum-based-bat-ico-raises-36-million-30-seconds-disrupt-advertising)

**Common Misconceptions about ICOs**

In order to navigate this complex landscape, you need to know more than just "what is an ICO."  It is equally important to understand what an ICO is not.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Misconception</td>
    <td>Explanation</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
ICO = IPO</td>
    <td> 
An ICO is not the same as an IPO.

There are many major differences between an ICO (that issues coins/tokens that may or may not be considered securities. An IPO issues stock/shares that are traded on an exchange and are legally considered to be securities.

Apart from the possible legal distinctions between coins/tokens and stock/shares, ICOs and IPOs are undertaken at different lifecycle stages of a company.Companies that issue an ICO typically do not qualify for a "traditional" IPO because they do not have an operating history, do not have audited financial statements, and usually do not have the needed level of corporate governance or internal controls. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
A coin/token is not a security</td>
    <td>
One of the most important issues surrounding ICOs is whether or not they constitute a security. Each country/jurisdiction has complex and detailed securities laws administered by a regulator that evaluate and determine what constitutes a security.

These criteria differ, sometimes subtly and sometimes dramatically,from country-to-country, and are described in more detail later in this document.

For a securities “expert”, some coins/tokens are relatively easy to categorize as either a security or as not a security. In other cases, depending on the jurisdiction, the company’s business model, the development stage of the company’s product, and to whom the coins/tokens are (or will be) issued, the categorization can be extremely uncertain and experts / courts could reasonably disagree. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
Issuing and ICO is a fast, inexpensive, and easy way to raise money.</td>
    <td> 
A successful (and legal) ICO requires at least 8-12 weeks (usually more) of preparation, a budget of hundreds of thousands of US dollars, engagement of several experts, and a lot of hard work to distribute and explain the vision and benefits that your company is trying to get others to invest in.
 </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
All ICOs are scams (or are amazing)</td>
    <td>
ICOs have come in all shapes and sizes of success. One of the largest ICOs in recent history was Tezos, which is still plagued by ongoing litigation between investors and the issuer (and other parties) in the United States and in Switzerland.

Others, such as waves.io, (which raised ~ $16m USD) have used the ICO process to raise money that has resulted in extremely successful, reliable, and useful products.</td>

Proprietary v.s.

    <td>

Pre-sales</td>
    <td>Pre-sales are optional—but as ICO is potentially an expensive exercise to run, some organizations sell a predetermined number of tokens (<10% overall volume of tokens released in ICO) to fund the ICO. While optional, practically pre-sales are mission-critical. This is the period that you offer Tokens privately, for a discount (20-25% maybe, depending on the amount invested) to a group of influencers. When the ICO proper begins you already have a good story, some prominent names attached, and good momentum. The flip side to this is that if you Pre-Sales flop, it is tough to dig out from that</td>
  </tr>
</table>


**BENEFITS OF AN ICO FOR THE ISSUING ORGANIZATION**

*  Build community + networking effect

    * The ICO model encourages adoption of your services (or operational nodes), which can be helpful to test and sustain activities on the application for better user experience.

* New Model of Financing

    * Open-source projects[13]— depending on case, ICO token users will have a chance to determine the development of the organization issuing the tokens, instead of just the board members.

    * Non-dilutive— issuing tokens helps your startup raise funding, but because token holders are not shareholders (except for the case of DAOs), your shares will not be diluted in an ICO event.

* Non-Discriminatory Investor Outreach

    * With an ICO, anyone can participate in the funding round (whereas issuing securities requires accredited investor status)

* Relatively Faster and Cheaper Fundraising Mechanism

    * ICO can be cheaper than traditional fundraising mechanisms.

        * E.g. Settlement over Blockchain simply requires monitoring and updating distributed ledgers

        * Less legal documents to fill in compared to IPOs

 

**Risks of Conducting an ICO**

* Business Risk with Smart Contracts

    * If a contract is not programmed correctly to match the plain-language higher-order specifications, this could lead to contracts executing in unexpected ways, including transfers of value without authorization from the tokens’ owner[14].

    * E.g. DAO[15] on Ethereum Chain.

* Business Risk with over concentration of Token Owners ("Whales")

    * Significant percentage of tokens held by a few holders— Should the tokens come with voting decisions, having a few, aggressive investors can significantly impact the direction of your business

* Regulatory Risk

    * If your ICO is considered a security in its issuing jurisdiction, several legal risks including:

        * Issuing tokens to non accredited investors

        * Violation of local securities laws

        * Public disclosure

 

* Systematic Risk with Blockchain which the Token operates on

    * Tokens will need to run on a Blockchain— in the case a blockchain has major issues (e.g. hard fork resulting from DAO leak), the tokens operating on the blockchain may be affected.

* Currency Risk with currencies (Crypto and Fiat alike)

    * After a successful ICO, your firm will amass funds in cryptocurrencies which are volatile.  If your selected cryptocurrency falls significantly in value, the capital you raised will be worth less in real world currency than you may have originally targeted. This is also true if you raise money in a tradition currency, which is subject to FX fluctuations.

* Reputation Risk if ICO did not turn out as expected

    * More than 50% of ICOs barely hit the minimum threshold for fundraising, so it is important to be aware of the downside scenario and the damage your reputation could incur if you are not successful in meeting your funding goals

* Hacker Risk with Decentralized Blockchain

    * As blockchains are decentralized, in theory everyone can see the code, which can make it vulnerable to hacking. That being said, once the blockchain is up and running, it will be very hard for hackers to attack the blockchain as it usually does not make economic sense to do so

    * E.g. Hacker Risk with Blockchain— the DAO hard fork

</table>


#### HOW MUCH DOES IT COST TO RAISE AN ICO?

* Expect costs to be at least **US$250k** (whether paid in fiat currency upfront or through the proceeds raised from the ICO itself)**, more likely US$500k (in light of the increasing regulatory complexity and high-number of ICO that create a crowded market)**, and up to US$1m (which reflects the specialized nature of International securities laws, government restrictions, and more complex structures that have evolved to ensure regulatory compliance and investor comfort).

* Prior to Q3 2017, many ICO issuers simply accepted the amounts that they raised with little, if any, legal obligations towards investors. Now, the fallout from highly-public ICO failures (such as the allegations and lawsuits involving Tezos), prospective token issuers are implementing additional safeguards (such as raising capital in tranches, agreeing to return 90% of monies raised if products do not launch, etc.) in order to attract investors.

    <td>ICO listing(s)</td>
    <td>US$50k

Each individual exchange (such as Coinbase, Bitfinex, Kraken, etc.), have their own fees for a newly-created Token to be issued so that it can be traded.

Often, these fees are quoted in cryptocurrency (i.e., Bitcoin, Etherium, etc.), and are NOT adjusted for ongoing market price changes.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Code Writing (external) and Audit Report</td>
    <td>US$25k

Mining and issuing the Tokens, and establishing the tokenization protocols (such as whether certain Tokens will be destroyed, restrictions on transfer, etc.) can either be done in-house, or by a specialist third party. Again, costs vary by the complexity and quality of work as well as whether or not the issuer will prepare an "Audit Report" to be shown to investors validating the Tokens and blockchain utilized.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Marketing Budget</td>
    <td>US$100k

Marketing budgets depend on the amount sought to be raised and any advertising restrictions based on the type of ICO (for example, tokens limited to Accredited Investors; restrictions on marketing to US or Chinese citizens, etc.). Previously ICO issuers established a “bounty campaign” (whereby independent third parties would promote an ICO and be rewarded with Tokens for doing so), but this practice is declining due to the prevalence of spam and artificial “likes”.</td>

#### How long does it take to raise an ICO?

* Base case scenario is 4-5 months

###### **Timeline**

* An ICO decision is made and the team must determine the utility of the token.

* 2-4 weeks to evaluate, negotiate with service providers, including:

    * Law Firm (at least 2 - US & Issuing Jurisdiction; probably 3 - US, UK/EU & Issuing Jurisdiction).

    * Issuer / Placement Agent

    * PR / Marketing

    * Technical Advisors (unless the team will code the Token themselves)

    * Rating Agencies

* 2-3 weeks (at least) to structure the ICO - i.e., is there going to be a cap on Tokens issued, what is the basis for Tokens, Pre-Sale discount; Amount held back for founders; Liquidity Issues (i.e., when will the Tokens actually be issued and able to be traded); Where will the issuing entity be (Switzerland, etc.) and how will it be controlled; Will there be a Greenshoe; etc. 

* 1 month (at least) to draft the White Paper. Part of this will be easy, part of this will be a slog since the structure may still be evolving, and part of this will be held up by the lawyers (particularly if there are Security concerns). Practically, this is done in parallel with a lot of other things (honing the PR message, reaching out to third parties, arranging a road show schedule, etc.), but still, nothing is going to really move forward until the Whitepaper is finalized.

* 2-4 weeks for Roadshow. Again, this is flexible and Road Shows are all shapes and sizes, a lot of it is going to conferences and evangelizing. If the Token is a security, then there is probably a more traditional roadshow speaking with institutional investors, etc.

* Pre-ICO sales begin. This could last a weekend or a week. Longer than 1-2 weeks is not standard.

* Mass marketing begins. Speak to a more general audience through Facebook/Reddit/Telegram/Slack/Medium, buy ads, write blog posts, and give presentations at meetups and conferences.

* ICO issuance begins. Could last a week or a month.

* Issuance is complete and then the Tokens need to be allocated - the "trend" now is using the SAFT (which is a SAFE for Tokens); however, there are other potential problems with this, neither of which is clearly a problem or clearly has a solution since the SEC has not given any guidance. The point being, the ICO work is still continuing even after it has been completed because the Tokens need to be issued and also need to be registered with exchanges (Kraken, Pulonium, etc.) in order to create a secondary market which actually generates a lot of the value.

#### APPENDIX 1

#### Glossary

Community

* Refers to Crypto Enthusiasts who often help out with the ICO process. They usually get included in Telegram/Slack channels, and participate on Bounty/Referral programs.

Contribution

* How much you pay, in Crypto or Fiat currencies, to support the ICO.

DAO

* Decentralized Autonomous Organization. Essentially a company run without a centralized management. Runs through rules encoded as computer programs, with transactions and records on the blockchain.

FCA

* Financial Conduct Authority, the financial regulator in the UK which also overlooks FinTech regulation.

Howey Test

* Test developed in the 1930s to determine whether a financial instrument is a security.

* An instrument is classified as a security if it fits into 1 of the following 4 criteria:

1) It is an investment of money

2) There is an expectation of profits from the investment

3) The investment of money is in a common enterprise

4) Any profit comes from the efforts of a promoter or third party

* More information on the Howey Test can be found on this link:

Nodes

* Anyone who owns the information of a blockchain, shares blocks and transactions across the network

Open Sourcing

* Codes, blueprints are shared to the community for free, enticing people to make changes and share the improved version of the codes back to the developers

Proof-of-Work

* Piece of data which is easy to verify but hard to create- on the Bitcoin Chain, it is for the computers to find out all the previous blocks created on the chain

Smart Contract

* Using a code to articulate, verify, and enforce an agreement between parties

White Paper

* Offering document for ICO. Currently no universal standard on what to cover- but should at least mention the technology, the utility case, the token structuring and distribution, as well as the team behind the ICO.
